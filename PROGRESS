So far, both c_vector and c_map work as expected. I have not found any memory leaks during the testing of either c_vector or 
c_map. Both c_vector and c_map allow for arbitrary data types (so long as the client calls the define_vector or define_map
macro) provided that they are one word. The project shows various aspects of OOP in C. Composition, aggregation, enapsulation,
abstraction are some of the main focuses of the project. In addition to that, I am in the process of implementing the iterator
design pattern. The wrapper facade pattern has been implemented throughout the program. 

For the most part, everything is complete and in a working state. The only thing is that I want to develop a better way of 
doing error handling. 

A makefile has been provided for ease of compilation and clean up. Simply type "make all" to compile all of the test files,
and "make clean" to remove the files.
